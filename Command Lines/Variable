 ENV is a shell command for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to either print a list of environment variables or run 
     another utility in an altered environment without having to modify the currently existing environment. Using env, variables may be 
     added or removed, and existing variables may be changed by assigning new values to them.
     
EXPORT VARIABLE_NAME='some value' is the way to set an environment variable in any POSIX-compliant shell. If the variable already has a 
      value, you can use export VARIABLE_NAME to make it an environment variable without changing its value.
      
SET create variable only for existing SHELL. If you create variable and then open new shell using /bin/bash you will not able to see this
variable until you will export it.
