MORE is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.  This version is especially primitive.  Users should realize that less
     provides more emulation plus extensive enhancements.

LESS is a program similar to more, but it has many more features.  Less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, 
     so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi.
