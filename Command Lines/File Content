MORE is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.  This version is especially primitive.  Users should realize that less
     provides more emulation plus extensive enhancements.

LESS is a program similar to more, but it has many more features.  Less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, 
     so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi.
   
TR - Translate or delete characters

root@kali:~# tr a-z A-Z <<< siem
SIEM
root@kali:~# 

NL - Write each FILE to standard output, with line numbers added.

OD - dump files in octal and other formats

WC - Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if more than one FILE is specified.  A word is a 
non-zero-length sequence of characters delimited by white space.

find / -name core > output.ok 2 > fille.err - Output goes to files output.ok and errors go to filer.err.
find / -name core > output.ok 2 > &1 - All goes to file output.ok
