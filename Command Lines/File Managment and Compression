TOUCH - Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time. If parametr doesn not exist it created new empty file.

LS - list directory contents
-a, --all - do not ignore entries starting with .
-d, --directory - list directories themselves, not their contents
-l - use a long listing format
-R, --recursive - list subdirectories recursively
-F - indicates directories by "/"

CP - copy files and directories

MV - move (rename) files

RM - remove files or directories
- rm * - remove all files
-r, -R, --recursive - remove directories and their contents recursively

MKDIR - make directories

RMDIR - remove empty directories
-r - recursiveq

GZIP - reduces  the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the 
       extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification times.
       
GUNZIP - can currently decompress files created by gzip, zip, compress, compress -H or pack

BZIP2 - compresses  files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is 
        generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the 
        performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.
        
BUNZIP2 -  (or bzip2 -d) decompresses all specified files.

 XZ - a general-purpose data compression tool with command line syntax similar to gzip and bzip2.
 
 UNXZ - decompress files created by XZ
