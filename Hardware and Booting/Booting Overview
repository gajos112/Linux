BIOS -> BOOTLOADER -> KERNEL -> INIT

- BIOS - test memory if there is enough to load krnerl and a little bit diagnostic, also default boot divce is define in BIOS.
- BOOTLOADER - Looking at the MBR, contains instruction to boot the system, partition information and location in hardware of KERNEL.
- KERNEL - More instruction, driver information from mouse, screen etc.
- INIT - Starts all progrms on comouter. Procces ID of 1, it starts web, mail server etc. 

dmesg - used to examine or control the kernel ring buffer. The default action is to display all messages from the kernel ring buffer.

ps - displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the
     displayed information, use top instead. To see every process on the system using standard syntax: ps -e, ps -ef

top -  The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display system summary information as well as a list
       of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel. The types of system summary information shown and the  types,
       order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be made persistent
       across restarts.
