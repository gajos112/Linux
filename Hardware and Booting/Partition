First disk /dev/sda other one /dev/sdb. Disk can be divinted to 4 main partinions: /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdb2, /dev/sdb3 and /dev/sdb4.
It is possible to create more partitions instead of partition sdb4 -> sdb5, sdb6 etc.

Partitino layout for client:
/dev/sdb1 - /boot
/dev/sdb2 - /
/dev/sdb3 - /home
/dev/sdb4 - swap

The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) provides tools to create virtual block devices from physical devices.  Virtual devices may 
be easier to manage than physical devices, and can have capabilities beyond what the physical devices provide themselves.  
A Volume Group (VG) is a collection of one  or  more  physical devices, each called a Physical Volume (PV). A Logical Volume (LV) 
is a virtual block device that can be used  by  the system  or  applications.  Each block of data in an LV is stored on one
or more PV in the VG, according to  algorithms  implemented  by  Device Mapper (DM) in the kernel.

Jeden volume moze byc z zbudowany np. z /dev/sda1 i dev/sdb1.
