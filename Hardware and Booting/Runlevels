Runlevels in Linux are seven and they are:

    0 = halt
    1 = single user
    2 = CLI, multi-user, no net
    3 = CLI, multi-user, networked
    4 = open
    5 = GUI, multi-user, networked
    6 = reboot

When you enter a specific runlevel, Linux will run some scripts that are located at:

- /etc/rc0.d Run level 0 
- /etc/rc1.d Run level 1 
- /etc/rc2.d Run level 2 
- /etc/rc3.d Run level 3 
- /etc/rc4.d Run level 4 
- /etc/rc5.d Run level 5 
- /etc/rc6.d Run level 6

who - Print information about users who are currently logged in.
who -r, --runlevel - print current runlevel
runlevel - Print previous and current SysV runlevel

init - systemd system and service manager
telinit - may be used to change the SysV system runlevel. Since the concept of SysV runlevels is obsolete the runlevel requests will
          be transparently translated into systemd unit activation requests
          
init 6 = reboot
shutdown -r — restarts
shutdown -s — shutsdown
shutdown -l — logoff
shutdown -t xx — where xx is number of seconds to wait till shutdown/restart/logoff
shutdown -i — gives you a dialog box to fill in what function you want to use
shutdown -a — aborts the previous shutdown command....very handy!
shutdown -h — hibernate. Easy mistake - it's not for help
shutdown -y — Removes all prompts at shutdown (Help not available in any documentation)

Additional options:
-f — Force the selected action
-t <seconds> — Set time to shutdown. Use -t 0 for "now"
-c <message> — Adds Message to Shutdown
