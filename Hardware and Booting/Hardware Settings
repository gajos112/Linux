lsmod - Show the status of modules in the Linux Kernel

modprope "module name" - Add and remove modules from the Linux Kernel. Modprobe looks in the module directory /lib/modules/`uname -r` 
      for all the modules and other files, except for the optional configuration files in  the /etc/modprobe.d directory.

modinfo "module name" - modinfo extracts information from the Linux Kernel modules given on the command line. If the module name 
      is not a filename, then the /lib/modules/version directory is searched, as is also done by modprobe(8) when loading kernel modules.

lspci - utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the system and devices connected to them. You can -v options for verbose.

lsusb - utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them. You can -v options for verbose.
