TCP Wrapper is a host-based networking ACL system, used to filter network access to Internet Protocol servers on (Unix-like) 
operating systems such as Linux or BSD. It allows host or subnetwork IP addresses, names and/or ident query replies, 
to be used as tokens on which to filter for access control purposes.

Access is controlled through /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny, these are respected by any service that uses libwrap, 
as well as the original inted.
